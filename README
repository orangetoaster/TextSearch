Lorne Schell:
This code sample I have included is a document comparison assignment from Data Structures III, to compute the similarity of two documents.
The similarity is a weighted cosine similarity, where search terms are weighted by their occurance in all documents and document terms are weighted logrithmically by their frequency in any particular document.
I think that this is a good example of my programming ability because the problem is well defined, the program is short and the purpose is relevant to search.

To compile:
	Requires JDK
	make
To test:
	Requires JUnit 4.
	make test
To run:
	Requires JRE
		make run
	OR 
		java -cp Build DocumentCompare.DocCompare <options>
	Options:
		-k <number of results to print> default 10
		-s <stopwords document> default stopwords.txt
		-f <query document> or -q <query document>
		-d <data directory> default set

To generate documentation:
	Requires doxygen
	make docs
