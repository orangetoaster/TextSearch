since the inception of the sdi concept by
 h. p. luhn in 1958, several iterations of programs have
evolved to produce what is now called an sdi-4 system .  the
 prime function of this system is to provide, in a timely and
 economical fashion, current information to those individuals
within the ibm company who have a need for that
 information .
