experiments are being performed to test the
 utility of a computer-connected cathode ray tube display in
 the man-machine processes of text editing and indexing,
 where a final output must be in machine as well as visual
 form .  results so far show that editing can be performed
faster than with a typewriter console, and that the immediate
 display response is very useful when several sequential editing
steps are needed in a local area of text .
