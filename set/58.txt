by use of relatively simple equipment, such
 as a sorter, and tabulator or document writer, a dictionary
 or thesaurus can be prepared .  the format of the thesaurus
can be designed to display a variety of relationships between
indexing terms .  the format of the thesaurus can be
 varied without changing its intellectual content to suit the
 habits and viewpoints of the user .  corrections, additions,
 and reverse entries to these indexing and retrieval aids can
 be made simply and easily .  the deck can be used in conjunction
with the listomatic method or computer-controlled
photo-composing devices to produce high-quality
 print-outs .
