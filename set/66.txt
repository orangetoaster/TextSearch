based on a comparison of : 1. existing systems;
2. tape processing; 3. internal functions; and 4. file
 maintenance problems, a linear file organization is found
 to be superior to an inverted one for searching on tape oriented
computer systems .  programing sophistication and
 machine configuration can change this relationship only in
 degree .
