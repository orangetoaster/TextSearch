programing and coding techniques used in medlars
.W
this paper describes some of the programing
logic of the medlars system .  the demand search
 module retrieves citations from the citation file initially on
 the basis of /significant/ elements, i. e ., elements having
 the lowest frequency of usage which must be present for a
 citation to satisfy the request .  the resultant file which is
 reduced in size is then passed against a decision table for
 the final selection of citations .  the report generator
 module formats the citations of printer paper, cards, or
 photograph film .  the output processing module formats
index medicus and recurring bibliographies, which
 are automatically updated by the system .  the final output
 is processed by the graphic arts composing equipment
 for later printing .
