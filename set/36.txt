a project for the computerization of book catalogues at the
harvard, yale and columbia medical libraries has three main objects :
to increase speed and completeness of information retrieval by
combining the card catalogues of the libraries and allowing
publication of the combined catalogue in book form ; to permit
future expansion of the information services ; to reduce the
administrative expenses of the libraries .
