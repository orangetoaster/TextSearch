an experiment was conducted in the sdi
 system at ibm-asdd to determine if the educational level
 of the encoder had a significant effect on the percentage
 of notifications regarded as relevant by the users .  considering
all 800 documents encoded, high school educated
 encoders had a significantly higher percentage of their
 notices regarded as relevant than did four college educated
 encoders .  eliminating documents for which no notifications
were sent, no significant difference was found between
the high school and college level encoders .
